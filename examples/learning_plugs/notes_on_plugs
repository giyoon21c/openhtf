manages external hardware and resources with reusable logic

Overview 

Hardware tests often require connections to external resources like
instruments, UUTs, or other softwares. OpenHTF manages these connections through
Plugs, reusable classes that handle resource initialization, control, and
cleanup, separating test logic from resource management for easier maintenance
and better logging.
